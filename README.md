# icub_rebranded
The diary to register all my steps to revive the icub residing in ROMER @ METU.


## Day2 (10.25.23):
- Checking [installation page](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/sw_installation/)
- Turns out need to install [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild)
  - Turns out I need to install [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [YCM](https://github.com/robotology/ycm) first. Check if you have cmake installed:
        ```bash
        cmake --version
        ```
  - [YCM documentation](https://robotology.github.io/ycm/gh-pages/latest/manual/ycm-installing.7.html)
  - [Source installation](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild#source-installation)


## Day1 (10.23.23):
- Cables checked, no cable lost. Though the connection scheme is different, no 3 different cables, just single one
- Cables and power sources cleaned.
- Power sources are put on table thanks to Harika hanim and umut and mehmet?
